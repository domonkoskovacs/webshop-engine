# Customizable webshop engine Project

This is an e-commerce web application developed as part of my computer science thesis. It features a Spring backend and React frontend, providing a user-friendly interface for browsing, purchasing, and managing products.

## Getting Started

To start the whole application, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

After startup, visit http://localhost:3000 to access the frontend.
